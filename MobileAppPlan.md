# Mobile Application Development Plan for Bolt.new

## App's Purpose
The Bolt.new mobile application aims to extend the capabilities of the Bolt.new platform to mobile devices, providing users with the ability to prompt, run, edit, and deploy full-stack applications directly from their smartphones. The app will enhance accessibility and usability, allowing users to work on their projects anytime, anywhere.

## Target Platforms
The mobile application will be developed for both iOS and Android platforms to reach a wider audience. We will use a cross-platform development framework, such as React Native or Flutter, to ensure a consistent user experience across both platforms while optimizing development resources.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality to access user-specific projects and settings.
- **Project Management**: Tools to create, edit, and manage projects, including file management and version control.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Features to collaborate with team members in real-time, including chat and shared editing.
- **Deployment Capabilities**: Ability to deploy applications directly from the mobile app to various hosting platforms.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications to keep users informed about project updates and collaboration requests.

## User Interface Design Considerations
The app will follow modern UI/UX design principles to ensure an intuitive and seamless user experience. We will use a design system that supports both light and dark modes, and ensure accessibility compliance. The design will be responsive to accommodate various screen sizes and orientations.
